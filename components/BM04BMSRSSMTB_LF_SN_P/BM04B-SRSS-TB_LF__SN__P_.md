# SH CONNECTOR 

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The SH is the world's first 1.0 mm pitch crimp style connector. It features a compact, low profile design in a wire-to-board configuration. Its unique contact engagement with the housing lance provides excellent performance in the contact insertion process when using smaller diameter wires. In addition, with a high-pressure contact design, the SH contact demonstrates excellent contact reliability providing an assured connection.

- Compact and space-saving
- Housing lance system
- High-pressure contact design for a more assured connection
- Socket compatible with IDC style SR connector
