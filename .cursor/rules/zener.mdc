<guide>
- `.zen` files use a Starlark-based language to define electronic components, modules, and boards as code.
- **Do not edit files in `components/`**: These are auto-generated using `pcb search <PART_NUMBER>`.
- **Create and edit reusable modules in `modules/`**: Modules combine components and logic. Use the format `name.zen`.
- **Boards go in `boards/`**: These instantiate modules for real-world use.
- Use the `mcp` server to run `pcb` commands and generate docs.
- Always use the `search` tool to add new components; never write component definitions by hand.
- Organize files:
    - `components/`: auto-generated, unmodified
    - `modules/`: user-authored logic
    - `boards/`: end-use designs
